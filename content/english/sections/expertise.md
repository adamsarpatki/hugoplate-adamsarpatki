# Expertise
expertise:
  - keyword: "Stengths, not weaknesses"
    icon: "/images/strength.png"
    content: "As a relatively new knitter, I'm aware of the challenges beginners face, which helps me make sure the patterns I edit are clear and beginner-friendly. And even though English is not my native language, that's actually a strength, not a weakness. Due to the fact that I spend most of my days immersed in English, either for work or for entertainment, I can spot sentences that are confusing from a non-native perspective."

  - keyword: "Detail-oriented"
    icon: "/images/book.png"
    content: "Whether it's a novel I'm working on, or a knitting pattern, I rarely take anything for granted. In this sense, I remain a librarianâ€”to me, my most memorable works are the ones which required me to do extensive research, for example, about Chinese history, the Hundred Years' War or the Cosmere."

  - keyword: "Disciplined independence"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "I started freelancing in 2013, and became a full-time freelancer in 2018. Through these years I've demonstrated that I am able to do quality work, to keep the deadlines, and to be a reliable team member."

  - keyword: "Communication"
    icon: "/images/messaging.png"
    content: "I prefer proactive communication, so I try to be proactive as well: I usually answer e-mails in 24-48 hours during the week (except on weekends and holidays), and if I'm out of the office for longer than that, I will always set an automatic message to let my clients know."
