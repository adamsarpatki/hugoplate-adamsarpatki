# Expertise
expertise:
  - keyword: "Stengths, not weaknesses"
    icon: "/images/strength.png"
    content: "English is my second language, and I've only been knitting since 2021. These things could be weaknesses, hindrances, but I think they're actually strengths in disguise. I spend most of my time consuming things in English, whether through reading or listening, and have been doing so since 2005. I tend to spot sentences that are confusing or complete gibberish, especially to someone who's not a native speaker. And since I'm a relatively new knitter, I still remember what it's like to be a beginner–this is also my point of view when editing patterns: Would a beginner know what to do?"

  - keyword: "Thoroughness"
    icon: "/images/book.png"
    content: "Whether it's a novel I'm working on, or a knitting pattern, I rarely take anything for granted. Sometimes I even look up things I know, to make sure I can be a 100% behind my decisions, and to make my editor's job easier. Consistency is important to me, so I usually create glossaries for most of my translations. In this sense, I remain a librarian–to me, my most memorable works are the ones for which I had to do extensive research about Chinese history, the Hundred Years' War or the Cosmere itself."

  - keyword: "Disciplined independence"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "I started freelancing in 2013, and became a full-time freelancer in 2018. Through these years I've demonstrated that I am able to do quality work, to keep the deadlines, and to be a reliable team member. For me, working from home is not a disadvantage, but an opportunity, to really focus on what I have on my plate on any given day. It's not without its challenges, and some days are more difficult than others, but after 10+ years I feel like it's safe to say I've got this figured out."

  - keyword: "Communication"
    icon: "/images/messaging.png"
    content: "Good communication is a key part of any workplace setting, and even more so if people are working remotely from one another. I have always valued people who are proactive in their communication–I don't like radio silence, especially when it lasts for weeks, and it takes multiple reminders to get a simple answer. Conversely, I try to be proactive as well: I usually answer e-mails in 24-48 hours during the week (except on weekends), and if I'm out of the office for longer than that, I will always set an automatic message to let you know."
