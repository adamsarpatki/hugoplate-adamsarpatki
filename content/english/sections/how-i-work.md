# Expertise
expertise:
  - keyword: "Unique advantages"
    icon: "/images/advantage.png"
    content: "As a relatively new knitter, I'm aware of the challenges beginners face, which helps me ensure the patterns I edit are clear and beginner-friendly. And even though English is not my native language, this is actually a strength, not a weakness. Because I spend most of my days immersed in English, either for work or entertainment, I can spot sentences that might be confusing from a non-native perspective."

  - keyword: "Communication"
    icon: "/images/messaging.png"
    content: "I prefer proactive communication, so I strive to be proactive as well. I usually respond to emails within 24-48 hours during the week (except on weekends and holidays). If I'm out of the office for longer than that, I always set an automatic message to let my clients and colleagues know."

  - keyword: "Detail-oriented"
    icon: "/images/book.png"
    content: "Whether it's a novel I'm working on or a knitting pattern, I rarely take anything for granted. In this sense, I remain a librarianâ€”I find that my most memorable works are the ones that required extensive research, for example, about Chinese history, the Hundred Years' War, or the Cosmere."

  - keyword: "Independence"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "I started freelancing in 2013 and became a full-time freelancer in 2018. Throughout these years I've demonstrated that I can deliver quality work, meet deadlines, and be a reliable team member."
