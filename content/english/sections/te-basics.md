## The basics

Hi, I'm Ádám! Don't be alarmed of those accents above the As, feel free to pronounce my name as Adam. Now that we're done with the difficult part, let me just say how glad I am that you made your way here! Are you a knitwear designer looking for someone to edit your pattern, and perhaps create a chart or two as well? Great! I would love to help. Read on, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

### Why work with me?

I am a detail-oriented editor who loves working on interesting and complex projects, and who double-checks everything to avoid any mistakes. I have a degree in library and information science, so researching things is nothing new. I am also an accomplished literary translator and editor—I have worked over 90 books in the last 10+ years.

In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by the lovely people at [The Tech Editor Hub](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/). I'm currently working toward earning [my TKGA certification](https://tkga.org/certification-for-technical-editors/). I am also an avid knitter, so I constantly learn new techniques, and I love a challenge.

Feel free to check out [the list of my publications](/publications/), or [my tech editor portfolio](/te-portfolio/) to see all the patterns I've edited so far. I also have [a list of my finished knitting projects](/my-knitting-projects/) that showcase my skills.

### What do I do as a tech editor?

**I check stitch counts and measurements.** Does the math of the pattern work? Is the pattern reasonable when held up to some sizing standard? Are the measurements converted correctly? Can a knitter achieve the measurements the pattern gives?

**I check schematics and charts.** Do the instructions match the chart(s)? Are the chart keys given and correct? Are the necessary schematics included? Does your schematic accurately represent the finished object?

**I check grammar and style.** Are your instructions clear and accurate? Is your style consistent? Are there any typos in the pattern? Does the layout make sense?

**I can also create custom charts and schematics for your pattern** if you wish.

### The process

1. You email me your pattern, your proposed deadline, a photo of your finished item, and anything else you feel is relevant. I reply with a quote, including my turnaround time and fee.
2. If we agree, we sign an agreement, then I start editing your pattern and drawing any requested charts and schematics. When I'm ready, I'll send everything back to you for review.
3. After the third round (or once the pattern feels ready), you publish the pattern or send it to your test knitters.
4. I send you my invoice, payable via Wise or Stripe in 15 days.
5. Once the test knitters are done, I do a final pass for free to catch anything we may have missed.
