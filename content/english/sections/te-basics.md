## What is technical editing?

Anyone who publishes any kind of text needs an editor, a fresh set of eyes to catch mistakes. Since knitting is a specialized area, that editor needs to be a person who knows the ins and outs of knitting.

**Technical editing for knitting patterns is the process of checking a pattern to make sure the numbers are correct, the style is consistent throughout, all the necessary instructions are there, and it is ready for publication.**

A technical editor does not knit the pattern, but checks it theoretically, with a calculator and/or a spreadsheet. The process, depending on the pattern's complexity, takes only a few hours compared to the many weeks or even months a test knitter works on a pattern.

**Tech editing has great value for pattern designers, since a well edited pattern results in a good experience for the makers.**

## My qualification

**Since 2012, I've worked on over 60 novels and short stories as a literary translator, and copyedited more than 20 novels.** I've also written articles on various topics. I have extensive experience working with various genres and collaborating with translators and editors from diverse backgrounds.

**In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by [The Tech Editor Hub](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/).** Joeli is a wonderful teacher who has taught me a great deal about the mechanics of tech editing for knitting patterns and the philosophy of working with pattern designers. And, since it offers a slightly different perspective, I enrolled in [the certification course offered by TKGA](https://tkga.org/certification-for-technical-editors/).

I'm also an avid knitter who loves learning new techniques and exploring new designs. Rest assured, if something is unfamiliar to me, I will don my librarian hat and start researching, at no extra cost to you.

## My philosophy

I know it can be daunting to entrust someone with something you've put so much hard work and dedication into. I feel the same way each time a new editor works on my translations.

This is why I strive to create a safe and friendly environment where you won't be judged if you make a mistake—instead, mistakes are just problems to be solved. No one has to know about them.

And even though I might highlight errors, and give suggestions on how to correct them, I will always, *always* leave the final decision to you. We'll collaborate, but the pattern will always remain yours. In slightly more legal terms: **You will retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.**

I'm here to make your pattern look its best, and to make this process go as painlessly as possible.
