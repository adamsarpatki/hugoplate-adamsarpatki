## The basics

### What is technical editing?

Technical editing for knitting patterns is the process of checking a pattern to make sure the numbers are correct, the style is consistent throughout, all the necessary instructions are there, and it is ready for publication.

### What do I do as a tech editor?

**I check grammar and style.** Are your instructions clear and accurate? Is your style consistent? Are there any typos in the pattern? Does the layout make sense?

**I check stitch counts and measurements.** Does the math of the pattern work? Is the pattern reasonable when held up to some sizing standard? Are the measurements converted correctly? Can a knitter achieve the measurements the pattern gives?

**I check schematics and charts.** Do the instructions match the chart(s)? Are the chart keys given and correct? Are the necessary schematics included? Does your schematic accurately represent the finished object?

**I can also create custom charts and schematics for your pattern** if you wish.

### My qualification

I'm an accomplished literary translator and editor—I have worked over 90 books in the last 10+ years.

In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by [The Tech Editor Hub](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/). I'm currently working toward earning [my TKGA certification](https://tkga.org/certification-for-technical-editors/).
