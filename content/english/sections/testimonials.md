    content: "Each time Ádám works on one of our books, whether it needs translating or editing, I know it’s in safe hands. He has an outstanding sense of language and style, and it’s great to see the dedication and care he devotes to each project. Additionally, his work on decidedly lengthy novels is always of exceptional quality. I consider him one of the most talented professionals among his younger peers."

    content: "Ádám was my colleague in the Hungarian Central Statistical Office Library, and we stayed friends even after we eventually moved on to work in separate (but related) creative fields. I often turn to him for advice, as he always provides excellent insights. He is thorough, willing to double-check everything. Remarkably patient and generous. He even made this website from scratch - I’m always impressed by his versatility!"

He is an expert at his craft, and his linguistic inventiveness and creativity are combined with remarkable organisational skills. He puts all his heart into his work, while remaining flexible and collaborative during the publishing process. It’s a pleasure working with him. He is consistent in his editing work, always looking to come to an agreement, and is always glad to help the development of colleagues who are open to his guidance."
