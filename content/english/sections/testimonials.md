    content: "Each time Ádám works on one of our books, whether it needs translating or editing, I know it’s in safe hands. He has an outstanding sense of language and style, and it’s great to see the dedication and care he devotes to each project. Additionally, his work on decidedly lengthy novels is always of exceptional quality. I consider him one of the most talented professionals among his younger peers."

  - name: "Mici Harangozó"
    designation: "TKGA Certified Knitwear Designer"

    content: "When I am designing, my brain is all over the place. I am thinking about dozens of design elements, stitch patterns, knitting techniques and how they affect each other, so their combination becomes a unique design piece and they eventually form a knitting pattern that is easy to follow but exciting to knit at the same time. It is such a relief to know that I can wander freely in all this creative chaos and I do not have to worry about spelling, wording or punctuation because I have Ádám to create perfect order at the end!"

    content: "Ádám was my colleague in the Hungarian Central Statistical Office Library, and we stayed friends even after we eventually moved on to work in separate (but related) creative fields. I often turn to him for advice, as he always provides excellent insights. He is thorough, willing to double-check everything. Remarkably patient and generous. He even made this website from scratch - I’m always impressed by his versatility!"

    designation: "Writer, editor, literary translator"

    content: "When it comes to accuracy and literary style, Ádám is an exceptionally meticulous and precise translator, who reliably meets his commitments and deadlines. He is an expert at his craft, and his linguistic ingenuity and creativity are combined with remarkable organisational skills. He puts all his heart into his work while remaining flexible and collaborative during the publishing process. It’s a pleasure working with him. He is consistent in his editing work, always striving to reach consensus, and is more than happy to help the development of colleagues who are open to his guidance."
