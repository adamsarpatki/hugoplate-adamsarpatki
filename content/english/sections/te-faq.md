{{< accordion title="PDF, DOC or something else?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

Either one is good.

If you send me a PDF, most likely I will create a flattened PDF so we don't run into any compatibility issues. (A flattened PDF just means that you won't be able to move or accidentally delete my comments. The quality will be unchanged, you'll still be able to zoom in, select the text, etc.) I am also familiar with Adobe Reader's annotation tools.

If you send me a Word or a Pages document, I will use "Track changes". (This is my preferred method.)

During the editing process, I won't change or rewrite the text of your pattern without your knowledge. I will give you my notes and suggestions, and you can decide what to incorporate and what not to.

{{< accordion title="Confidentiality" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I will keep our every e-mail and file confidential, and I will never send or say anyone anything about our work, unless you instruct me to. In return, I ask you to do the same.

This obviously doesn't apply to the fact that I edited your pattern: I will proudly share the news of its publication on social media, and will include its photo in my portfolio (with your permission, of course), as well as a link to your website or Ravelry store.

{{< accordion title="Credit" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

While it's not necessary to do so, I would be over the moon if you would credit me in the colophon of your pattern. I think it's generally a nice thing to do, and including my name also gives credibility to your work, showing people that this pattern was professionally tech edited. If you credit me, you will still retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.
