{{< accordion title="What file formats do you accept?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

Anything Microsoft Word or Pages can handle is good (.docx, .rtf or .pages), and I accept PDFs as well.

If you send me a Word or Pages document, I will use "Track changes" and Comments to tech edit your pattern. (This is my preferred method.)

For PDFs, I am familiar with Adobe Reader's annotation tools, so you can easily import my comments into InDesign.

During the editing process, I won't change or rewrite the text of your pattern without your knowledge. I will give you my notes and suggestions, and you can decide what to incorporate and what not to.

{{< accordion title="How do you calculate the word count of a pattern?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

If you send me a Word or Pages document, I'll use the program's built-in word count tool. If you send me a PDF, I will copy the text into Word, and then check the word count.

**Note:** Converting text from PDF to Word may slightly inflate the word count, as formatting issues can occasionally split words. To ensure an accurate count and avoid overcharging, I recommend sending your file as a Word or Pages document whenever possible.

{{< accordion title="What if a pattern needs rewriting or more than three rounds of editing?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I won't rewrite your work for you, but I will flag any areas that may need substantial revision and offer clear suggestions to help you improve them.

If your pattern still needs editing after three rounds, additional work is billed at €35/hour, in 15-minute increments. However, I will always check in with you if we need to move beyond the original scope of the project.

{{< accordion title="Confidentiality" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I will keep our every e-mail and file confidential, and I will never send or say anyone anything about our work, unless you instruct me to. In return, I ask you to do the same.

This obviously doesn't apply to the fact that I edited your pattern: I will proudly share the news of its publication on social media, and will include its photo in my portfolio (with your permission, of course), as well as a link to your website or Ravelry store.

{{< accordion title="Credit" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

While it's not necessary to do so, I would be over the moon if you would credit me in the colophon of your pattern. I think it's generally a nice thing to do, and including my name also gives credibility to your work, showing people that this pattern was professionally tech edited. If you credit me, you will still retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.
