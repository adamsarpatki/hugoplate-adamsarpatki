      You [contact me](/contact) for availability.
      
      **Please include, if possible:** (1) your pattern with some photos of the finished item; (2) your deadline; (3) anything else you think would be useful for me to know. (E.g., whether your pattern has been test knitted or not; whether I should pay extra attention to certain parts, etc.)

      I let you know whether I can take on the pattern. My response will include my turnaround time (usually 5-7 days), the estimated hours the project will require, my estimated fee, and my contract.
      
      I usually respond within 24–48 hours, except on weekends and holidays, and I have an auto-reply if I’m away longer.

      We sign the agreement through DocuSign.
      
      If you need assistance, I'll gladly help—or you can check out [this article](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-do-I-sign-a-DocuSign-document-Basic-Signing?language=en_US) on how to use their free service. (Your scanned signature is not required.)

      I edit the pattern. After the first round, I will send it back to you to make the necessary changes. Then you send it back to me to check it again for anything we missed.
      
      I will contact you immediately if I have any questions or concerns, or if the work requires more time than I thought, to discuss the best course of action.

  - process_step: "Step 5/6"

      When your pattern is ready to be sent to test knitters or published, I will invoice you the final amount, payable via Wise or Stripe within 15 days.
      
      My fee will be in euros, or in forints if you're based in Hungary.

  - process_step: "Step 6/6"

      After test knitting, I will gladly take a look at the pattern again for any additional corrections, in case we missed anything.
      
      This step is free if no changes are needed or if they take less than 30 minutes.
