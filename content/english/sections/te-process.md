      You [contact me](/contact) for availability. Please include the following files and info, if you have them:

      - Your pattern, even if it's not yet the version you want edited. You can send me a PDF, but a Word file or a Pages file is good as well. (See FAQ for more on this.)
      - Some photos of the finished item, so I can check if the pattern would produce the item or not. These images don't have to be fancy, I just need to see details like the ribbing, the stitch pattern, the general shape etc.
      - Your style sheet if you have one.
      - The date by which you would send me the version to be edited.
      - Your deadline if you already have one.
      - Whether your pattern has already been test knitted or not.
      - Whether there are parts of your pattern I should pay extra attention to, or if there are any parts I shouldn't bother with.

  - process_step: "Step 2/6"

    content: " In my response, I will let you know if I can take on the pattern or not, about my turnaround time (usually 5-7 days), the estimated hours the project will require, and my estimated fee. I usually answer within 24-48 hours, except on weekends and holidays, and have an auto-reply set up if I’m away for more time than that. I will also send you my agreement, so you can check my terms."

  - process_step: "Step 3/6"
    icon: "/images/book.png"
    content: "We sign the agreement through DocuSign. (If you need assistance with it, I will gladly help, or check out [this article](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-do-I-sign-a-DocuSign-document-Basic-Signing?language=en_US) on how to use their free service. You don't need to scan your signature to use this service.)"

  - process_step: "Step 4/6"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "After we're set, I start editing the pattern. When the first round is done, I will send it back to you to make the necessary changes. Then you send it back to me, to check it again for anything we missed. I will contact you immediately if I have any questions or concerns, or if the work requires more time than I thought, to talk about the best course of action."

  - process_step: "Step 5/6"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "When your pattern is ready to be sent to test knitters or published, I will send you my invoice, which you can pay via Wise within 15 days. My fee will be in Euros or, if you're based in Hungary, in Hungarian Forint. You may [use this currency converter](https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/) to check how much that will cost you in your own currency."

  - process_step: "Step 6/6"
    icon: "/images/deadline.png"
    content: "After your pattern has been test knitted, and you've received your feedback from your test knitters, I will be happy to take a look at the pattern again for any additional corrections, just in case we missed something. This step is free if there are no changes to be made or they don't require much time."
