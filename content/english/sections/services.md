    **Since 2012, Iâ€™ve worked on over 60 novels and short stories as a literary translator, and edited more than 20 novels.** Iâ€™ve also written numerous articles on various topics. I have extensive experience working with different genres and collaborating with translators and editors from diverse backgrounds.
    
    Even though my calendar for any given year is usually filled with projects from my current clients, I would be happy to talk shop, and maybe make space for new projects. ðŸ˜Ž

    **Important to note: currently I only translate from English to Hungarian, and I only edit texts written in Hungarian.**

    **In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by The Tech Editor Hub.** Joeli is a wonderful teacher who has taught me a great deal about the mechanics of tech editing for knitting patterns and the philosophy of working with pattern designers. ðŸ˜Š

    **I currently offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.**

    My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos.
