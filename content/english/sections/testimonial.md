    content: "Each time Ádám works on one of our books, whether it needs translating or editing, I know it’s in safe hands. He has an outstanding sense of language and style, and it’s great to see the dedication and care he devotes to each project. Additionally, his work on decidedly lengthy novels is always of exceptional quality. I consider him one of the most talented professionals among his younger peers."
