    content: "As a relatively new knitter, I'm aware of the challenges beginners face, which helps me make sure the patterns I edit are clear and beginner-friendly. I also think that although English is not my native language, that's actually an advantage. Due to the fact that I spend most of my days immersed in English, either for work or for entertainment, I can spot sentences that are confusing from a non-native perspective."
