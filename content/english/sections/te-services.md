services:
    - process_step: "Knitting tech editing"
      icon: "images/wool.png"
      content: |
        **My editing rate is €0.05 per word**. It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check. The final check is free if no changes are needed or if they take less than 30 minutes.

        **For the first two patterns I edit for you, you'll receive a 25% discount, so my per word rate will only be €0.0375.**

        I'll use your original file to calculate my fee, this way you'll know exactly how much my services will cost you. (See FAQ for more info.)
        
        Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe. (Wise preferred.) My rate was calculated based on an hourly rate of €35 and [the editorial rates listed by the Editorial Freelancers Association](https://www.the-efa.org/rates/).

    - process_step: "Charts & schematics"
      icon: "images/sweater.png"
      content: |
        My charts and schematics cost a flat fee:

        | Service | Cost per item |
        | ------------- | ---- |
        | Simple chart | €10 |
        | Complicated chart | €15 |
        | Schematic | €20 |

        <br/>
        
        You can hire me only for these services, but **if I am the tech editor of your knitting pattern, then the 25% discount will apply for these items as well.** (For your first two patterns.)
        
        My rate includes three rounds of revisions. Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe. (Wise preferred.)
