        **My editing rate is €0.05 per word**. It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check. The final check is free if no changes are needed or if they take less than 30 minutes.

        **For the first two patterns I edit for you, you'll receive a 25% discount, so my per word rate will only be €0.0375.**

        I'll use your original file to calculate my fee, this way you'll know exactly how much my services will cost you.
        
        Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe. (Wise preferred.) My rate was calculated based on an hourly rate of €35 and [the editorial rates listed by the Editorial Freelancers Association](https://www.the-efa.org/rates/).

    - process_step: "Charts & schematics"
      icon: "images/sweater.png"
      content: |
        **If I am the tech editor of your knitting pattern,** charts and schematics cost a flat fee:

        | Service | Cost per item |
        | ------------- | ---- |
        | Simple chart | €10 |
        | Complicated chart | €15 |
        | Schematic | €20 |

        <br/>
        
        **If I am not the tech editor of your knitting pattern,** then my hourly editing fee of €35 applies, billed in 10-minute increments with a one-hour minimum. I will always provide you with an estimate beforehand.
        
        **My rate includes three rounds of revisions.** Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe. (Wise preferred.)
