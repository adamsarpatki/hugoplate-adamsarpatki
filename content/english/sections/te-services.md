        **I currently offer tech editing for accessories,** mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.
        
        I will check spelling, grammar, use of style, written instructions (including clarity and accuracy), consistency, abbreviations, stitch counts, stitch patterns and repeats, measurements, conversions, schematics, charts with key.
        
        **Techniques I'm especially interested in:** stranded colourwork, cable knitting, brioche.

        *Please see **"The Process"** below for more details.*

        **My hourly editing fee is €35** (+ VAT if applicable). It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check.

        **For the first two patterns I edit for you, you'll receive a 25% discount.** (This offer is subject to change.)

        Small, simple items might need 1-2 hours, while larger, more complicated designs could require 3-4 hours to edit. But I'll always give you an estimate beforehand.
        
        Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe.

        (I mentioned VAT for transparency's sake, but I most likely wouldn't need to charge you any. I'll clarify the details if needed.)

    - process_step: "Knitting charts & schematics"

        I would gladly help you with creating charts and schematics for your knitting pattern. Ideally, I would also tech edit your pattern, but you can hire me just for these two services.

        For schematics, I use Affinity Designer, a very similar software to Adobe Illustrator, capable of creating vector graphics.

        For knitting charts, I use a charting software, but I can also use Affinity Designer if so desired.

        *Please see **"The Process"** below for more details.*

        **If I am the tech editor of your knitting pattern,** charts and schematics cost a flat fee:

        | Service | Cost per item |
        | ------------- | ---- |
        | Simple chart | €15 |
        | Complicated chart | €25 |
        | Schematic | €15 |
        
        `+` VAT if applicable.
        
        **If I am not the tech editor of your knitting pattern,** then my hourly editing fee of €35 applies (+ VAT if necessary), with a one-hour minimum. I will always provide you with an estimate.
        
        **My rate includes three rounds of revisions.** Payments can be made via Wise or Stripe.

        (I mentioned VAT for transparency's sake, but I most likely wouldn't need to charge you any. I'll clarify the details if needed.)
