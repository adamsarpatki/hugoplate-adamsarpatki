        **I currently offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.**
        
        **Techniques I'm especially interested in:** stranded colourwork, cable knitting, brioche.

        My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos.

        This means that I will check: spelling, grammar, use of style, written instructions (including clarity and accuracy), consistency, abbreviations, stitch counts, stitch patterns and repeats, measurements, conversions, schematics, charts with key.

        **My hourly editing fee is €35** (+ VAT if applicable). It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check.

        **For the first two patterns I edit for you, you'll receive a 25% discount.** (This offer is subject to change.)

        When you contact me, I will give you an estimated time-range, so you'll know what to expect.

        Small, simple items might need 2-3 hours, while larger, more complicated designs could require 4-5 hours to edit.
