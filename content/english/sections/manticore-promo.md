      Once a month I send out a short but sweet newsletter that includes my current available tech editing spots, as well as some stuff I found useful or interesting in the previous monthâ€”whether it's a video, a podcast episode, an article or a conversation.

      The topics include knitting, cooking, books, video games, TTRPGs, or anything, really, that interests me at the time.

      It's free, there's no catch, and you can unsubscribe at any time. Clicking the button below will take you to my Substack page.
