  intro: | 
    a <span class="font-bold text-indigo-400">literary translator and editor</span>. The main body of my work is in the fantasy and science fiction genres, but since 2013 I have also worked on some YA fiction, non-fiction and popular science books.

    As of 2024, I added <span class="font-bold text-indigo-400">technical editing for knitting patterns</span> to my services.

    When working with my clients, I aim to create a drama-free, respectful and detail-oriented atmosphere. To me, the quality of the end product is one of the most important things, whether it's a 1000-page novel or a two-paragraph blurb.

    Are you interested in collaborating?
