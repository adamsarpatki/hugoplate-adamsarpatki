## What is technical editing?

Anyone who publishes any kind of text needs an editor, a fresh set of eyes to catch mistakes. Since knitting is a specialized area, that editor needs to be a person who knows the ins and outs of knitting.

{{< highlight >}}

**Technical editing for knitting patterns is the process of checking a pattern to make sure the numbers are correct, the style is consistent throughout, all the necessary instructions are there, and it is ready for publication.**

{{< /highlight >}}

A technical editor does not knit the pattern, but checks it theoretically, with a calculator and/or a spreadsheet. The process, depending on the pattern's complexity, takes only a few hours compared to the many weeks or even months a test knitter works on a pattern.

**Tech editing has great value for pattern designers, since a well edited pattern results in a good experience for the makers.**

## My qualification

**Since 2012, I've worked on over 60 novels and short stories as a literary translator, and copyedited more than 20 novels.** I've also written articles on various topics. I have extensive experience working with various genres and collaborating with translators and editors from diverse backgrounds.

**In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by [The Tech Editor Hub](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/).** Joeli is a wonderful teacher who has taught me a great deal about the mechanics of tech editing for knitting patterns and the philosophy of working with pattern designers. And, since it offers a slightly different perspective, I enrolled in [the certification course offered by TKGA](https://tkga.org/certification-for-technical-editors/).

I'm also an avid knitter who loves learning new techniques and exploring new designs. Rest assured, if something is unfamiliar to me, I will don my librarian hat and start researching, at no extra cost to you.

## My philosophy

I know it can be daunting to entrust someone with something you've put so much hard work and dedication into. I feel the same way each time a new editor works on my translations.

This is why I strive to create a safe and friendly environment where you won't be judged if you make a mistake—instead, mistakes are just problems to be solved. No one has to know about them.

And even though I might highlight errors, and give suggestions on how to correct them, I will always, *always* leave the final decision to you. We'll collaborate, but the pattern will always remain yours. In slightly more legal terms: **You will retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.**

I'm here to make your pattern look its best, and to make this process go as painlessly as possible.

## My services

{{< highlight >}}

**I currently offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.**

{{< /highlight >}}
  
**Techniques I'm especially interested in:** stranded colourwork, cable knitting, brioche.

My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos.

This means that I will check: spelling, grammar, use of style, written instructions (including clarity and accuracy), consistency, abbreviations, stitch counts, stitch patterns and repeats, measurements, conversions, schematics, charts with key.

**I'm planning these services in the future:**

- Tech editing for sweaters
- Grading
- Creating schematics
- Creating style sheets
- Layout design

### Fees

{{< highlight >}}

**My hourly editing fee is €35** (+ VAT if applicable). It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check.

**For the first two patterns I edit for you, you'll receive a 25% discount.** (This offer is subject to change.)

When you contact me, I will give you an estimated time-range, so you'll know what to expect.

Small, simple items might need 2-3 hours, while larger, more complicated designs could require 4-5 hours to edit.
