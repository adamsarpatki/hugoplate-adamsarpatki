Currently I offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.

Techniques I'm especially interested in: stranded colorwork, cable knitting, brioche

My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos. For more info about my process, [read here.](/process)

Since I'm only starting out, for my first few clients I'm charging a flat fee:

- Small, simple items (e.g. items with basic brioche, simple charts and shaping): €70 (+ VAT if applicable)
- Complex items (e.g. items with complicated charts and shaping): €120 (+ VAT if applicable)

The flat fee includes any necessary revision rounds.

When you [contact me,](/contact) I will inform you about my estimated turnaround time, as well as about my fee, so you'll always know what to expect.

When you're ready to jump right in, please read the [Work with Me](/process) page for more practical info. And if you're still unsure about some things, I would be happy to answer your questions, so just [drop me a line.](/contact)
