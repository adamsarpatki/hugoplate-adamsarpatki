      Let's start at the beginning.

      During my childhood/teenage years, we didn't have Internet at home, and even when we did get it, it was painfully slow. Smartphones? No, sir, our phones were only capable of making calls and sending texts, nothing more. So, when I found myself with too much time on my hands and none of my friends available, I usually went to the library.

      I was always fascinated by libraries and librarians who could conjure up anything you were looking for, so it's not surprising that I graduated from Eötvös Loránd University as a library and information scientist, which is a fancy way of saying: a librarian. I wanted to become this wise and awe-inspiring owl of a person with the universe at his fingertips.

      Following graduation, I worked at two quite prominent libraries: the Central Library of the Hungarian Province of the Piarist Order, and the Library of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. I worked as a cataloguing librarian, then later, at the public library section of the HCSO, as a reference librarian. And while I never became a wise and awe-inspiring owl, certainly not at 27 years of age, both were exciting opportunities, I met many great people, including one of my best friends. I also started contributing articles about speculative fiction to *SFmag*, an online magazine. However, another passion of mine was calling my name...

      I was always fascinated by books. As a teenager, I aspired to become a writer—we had a small writing group in high school; we would read and critique each other's work. That's when I first got interested in editing and translation, too. I attribute it all to Tamás Boldizsár Tóth, the Hungarian translator of the Harry Potter books. Between 1999 and 2008, regardless of how the author's public perception changed since then, the series left a big impression on me.

      In 2011 and 2012, while at university, I attended a literary translator workshop called MűMű, lead by Zsuzsa Hetényi, where we each had the opportunity to work on texts both as translators and editors. At the end of the year, these texts  got published, resulting in *Pofon* and *2Pofon*, two anthologies that I'm still immensely proud of—my first proper translations were two short stories by Sir Terry Pratchett.

      By 2016, I had a number of short stories and shorter novels under my belt, and I started working with Delta Vision, a Hungarian publisher of science fiction and fantasy works—in my free time, of course, since by then I had a job as a social media manager/customer service representative at a well-known Hungarian publishing group, GABO-Ciceró-Akkord. It was during this period that I learned how to effectively manage deadlines and establish healthy boundaries.

        I like learning new things. So when I received my first editing assignment from Delta Vision in 2018, I was over the moon. And it was a book by Brandon Sanderson! I already worked as a translator on his works, but editing some of them as well was a dream come true.

        By the end of the year I felt like I had ample experience to start freelancing full-time. And I never looked back.

        I love the people I work with, and since I'm an introvert, I enjoy spending a lot of my time alone with one text or another. It's not all sunshine and rainbows, but I am able to set much healthier boundaries for myself, like not working after 5 p.m., and not working on the weekends. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but most of the time no lives are lost if I rest and recharge a bit.

      In the last few years, I've been exploring new hobbies.

      I've had a short fling with UX/UI design, a fascinating area I'd love to revisit someday. I also began drawing fantasy maps, initially for our homebrew game, but now I [have a blog](https://flightlessmanticore.com/) and even a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@flightless.manticore) under the name *The Flightless Manticore*—it's an inside joke.

      Then at the end of 2021, I took up knitting. I just had to try it. And I haven't stopped since. The idea of handmade clothes isn't foreign to me (my dad is a tailor), and since sewing machines intimidate me a bit, knitting is the next best thing.

      I have a shamefully large stash of yet-to-be-used yarn, including quite a few hand-dyed hanks by some lovely indie dyers. I love attending fibre festivals and meeting new people who share the same hobby. As an introvert and a bit socially awkward among new people, that's saying a lot. Knitting is something I could do 24/7 if the joints in my hands allowed it.

      As for tech editing, the lightbulb moment came in December 2023, when I was happily knitting away, not a care in the world, watching Roxanne Richardson's channel about some technique or another, and a video popped up that immediately caught my attention: [Knitting Tech Editors and Why They're So Important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPJlHIBVyhA). I never realised knitting tech editors even existed! Of course they did, but why didn't I know about them? Why didn't I know this would be an ideal career for me? I knew I had to try it, so I immediately took a deep dive.

      This job combines my love of editing with my love of knitting, yet it's so different from my usual novels and short stories. It's not better or worse, just different—refreshing.

      Don't worry, I'm not planning on giving up literary translation and editing novels. But tech editing is something unexpected, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
