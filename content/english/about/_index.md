        Let's start at the beginning.
        
        During my childhood/teenage years, I was always fascinated by libraries. They just had so many books, and you had to use a catalogue to find anything, and I mean *anything*! And there were these lovely people called librarians, who knew how to use the catalogue, and could conjure up anything you were looking for. Of course, back then we didn't have Internet at home, and even when we did get it, it was painfully slow. Smartphones? No, sir, our phones knew how to call people and send texts, and that's it. So when I had too much time on my hands, and none of my friends were available, I usually went to the library.

        So it's not surprising that I graduated from E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University as a library and information scientist, which is a fancy way of saying: a librarian. I wanted to become someone who helps others, who knows where everything is, and is like this wise and awe-inspiring owl of a person with the universe at their fingertips.
        
        During the next few years I worked at two quite prominent libraries: the Central Library of the Hungarian Province of the Piarist Order, and the Library of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. I got to work as a cataloguing librarian, as well as at the circulation desk at the public library section of the Library of the HCSO. And while I never became a wise and awe-inspiring owl, certainly not at 27 years of age, both were exciting opportunities, I met many great people, including one of my best friends. However, another passion of mine was calling my name...

      I was always fascinated by books. As a teenager, I wanted to become a writer--we had a writing group in our high school, just a few friends; we were reading and critiquing each other's writing. That's when I first got interested in editing, too. And translation. Oh, I blame it all on Tam√°s Boldizs√°r T√≥th, the Hungarian translator of the Harry Potter books. Regardless of how the author's public perception changed, at that time--between 1999 and 2008--the series left a big impression on me.

      In the end, between 2011 and 2012, at university I attended a literary translator workshop called M≈±M≈±, lead by Zsuzsa Het√©nyi, where we each got to translate some short works--poems, short stories, that sort of thing--, we critiqued them, and we each got a partner who edited our works. These texts then got published at the end of the year, resulting in *Pofon* and *2Pofon*, two anthologies that I'm still really proud of--I got to work on two short stories by Sir Terry Pratchett, which is still a highlight of my career.

      By 2016, I had 4 short stories and 2 shorter books published in Galaktika, a Hungarian SFF magazine, and I was already working with Delta Vision, a Hungarian publisher of SFF works on some of my most important translations, namely Scott Lynch's Red Seas Under Red Skies, and Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings. These took a lot of work during the afternoons, but I've had a lot to learn, both about the art of translation, and about being a freelancer--setting deadlines, invoicing, keeping confidential information confidential, and setting healthy boundaries.

      Later I started working as a social media manager and customer service person at a Hungarian publishing group, GABO-Akkord-Cicer√≥, where I got to translate some short stories as well.

      Then, in 2018, Delta Vision offered me my first opportunity to edit a novel. I never got any formal education in editing, but I had many an editor work on my translations by then, so I gave it a go.

      By the last half of 2018, I wanted a change. At the time I didn't do well navigating in-house politics and drama, and a lot of times I felt like I had tasks to do just to fill out my time, not because anyone cared about the results. (Well, I did, but that got lonely fast.) I wanted to do something useful, something that would bring value to people, and something I could find fulfillment in. I wanted to learn new things.

      And I was doing exactly that in my free time, translating and editing. So I saw an opportunity, gave this full-time freelancer thing a go, and never looked back.

      I love the people I'm working with, and since I'm an introvert, I enjoy that a lot of my time is spent alone with one text or another. It's not all sunshine and rainbows, but I can manage it much better, and I was able to set much healthier boundaries for myself, like not working after 5, and not working on the weekends. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but most of the time no lives are lost if I rest and recharge a bit.

      Well, in the last few years I started exploring new hobbies and things that interest me.

      I had a short fling with UX/UI design, which is a fascinating area I'd love to get back to some time, but for now, I didn't want to give up translating and editing for something that would be just another job, so I put it aside for now.

      Then at the end of 2021, I started knitting. I just had to try it. And I haven't stopped knitting ever since. I come from a family with a tailor father, so the idea of hand-made clothes isn't such an alien idea to me, and I probably would try sewing if I could only get over my fear of the sewing machine... üòÖ

      I have a shamefully large stash of yet-to-be-used yarn, including quite a few hand-dyed hanks by some lovely indie dyers. I love going to fibre festivals and meeting new people who have the same hobby. I'm an introvert, and a bit socially awkward among new people, so that's saying a lot, coming from me.

      As far as tech editing goes, the lightbulb moment came in December 2023, when I was happily knitting away, not a care in the world, watching Roxanne Richardson's channel about some technique or another, and a video popped up that immediately caught my attention: [Knitting Tech Editors and Why They're So Important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPJlHIBVyhA). I never realised knitting tech editors even existed! Of course they existed, but why didn't I know about them? Why didn't I know this would be an ideal career for me? I knew I had to try it, so I immediately took a deep dive.

      This job combines my love of editing with my love of knitting, yet it's so different from my usual novels and short stories. It's not better or worse, just different.

      Don't worry, I'm not planning on giving up literary translation and editing novels. But tech editing is something unexpected, and I can't wait to see where it'll take me.
