    Even though my calendar for any given year is usually filled with projects from my current clients, I would be happy to talk shop, and maybe make space for new projects.

    Feel free to contact me via e-mail, or book a spot on my calendar so we can have a chat.

    **Important to note: currently I only translate from English to Hungarian, and I only edit texts written in Hungarian.**

    For now, I have limited availability for tech editing projects. I can usually guarantee one or two slots per week.

    I like planning ahead, so **please contact me in time about your project.** The earlier you contact me, the more likely I will be able to fit your design into my schedule. ðŸ˜Š

    Before contacting me, [please read about my Tech Editing services,](/technical-editing) if you haven't done so already.

    If this would be our first contact, **please don't book a slot**, but instead e-mail me so we can hash out the details.

**For publishers and designers:** Depending on whether you're interested in working with me on a translation/editing project, or a knitting pattern, you have different options of contacting me. You can email me at [hello@adamsarpatki.com,](mailto:hello@adamsarpatki.com) use the "Email me" buttons below, or even book a chat with me. I will have different timeslots available for each category, so please choose the one that best describes you.

**If you just want to chat,** please use my social media channels linked in the footer. ðŸ˜Š
