    Even though my calendar for any given year is usually filled with projects from my current clients, I would be happy to talk shop, and maybe make space for new projects.

    Feel free to contact me via e-mail, or book a spot on my calendar so we can have a chat.

    **Important to note: currently I only translate from English to Hungarian, and I only edit texts written in Hungarian.**

    I can usually guarantee one or two slots per week.

    I like planning ahead, so **please contact me in time about your project.** The earlier you contact me, the more likely I will be able to fit your design into my schedule. ðŸ˜Š

    Before contacting me, [please read about my Tech Editing services,](/technical-editing/) if you haven't done so already.

    Feel free to contact me via e-mail, or book a spot on my calendar so we can have a chat.
