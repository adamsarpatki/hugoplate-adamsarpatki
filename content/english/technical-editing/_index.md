## What is technical editing?

Anyone who publishes any kind of text needs an editor, a fresh set of eyes to catch mistakes. And since knitting is a specialized area, that editor needs to be a person who knows the ins and outs of knitting.

{{< highlight >}}

**Technical editing for knitting patterns is the process of checking a pattern to make sure the numbers are correct, the style is consistent throughout, all the necessary instructions are there, and it is ready for publication.**

{{< /highlight >}}

A technical editor does not knit the pattern, but checks it theoretically, with a calculator and/or a spreadsheet. The process, depending on the pattern's complexity, takes only a few hours vs. the many weeks or even months a test knitter works on a pattern.

Tech editing has great value for pattern designers, since a well edited pattern results in a good experience for the knitters.

## My qualification

**Since 2012, I've worked on over 60 novels and short stories as a literary translator, and edited more than 20 novels.** I've also written articles on various topics. I have extensive experience working with various genres and collaborating with translators and editors from diverse backgrounds.

Feel free to check out the list of my publications [here.](/publications)

**In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by [The Tech Editor Hub.](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/)** Joeli is a wonderful teacher who has taught me a great deal about the mechanics of tech editing for knitting patterns and the philosophy of working with pattern designers.

I'm also an avid knitter who loves learning new techniques and exploring new designs. Rest assured, if something is unfamiliar to me, I will don my librarian hat and start researching.
  
## My philosophy

Giving your pattern you've worked on so hard to someone else can be a nerve-wracking experience. I get it, I've been thereâ€”even after a decade I feel the same way every time I turn in one of my translations. What if they'll mess everything up? What if they'll think I'm a fake or bad at my job?

**Don't worry, I won't think that, and I won't mess up your pattern.** I'll point out errors and places where something is not right, but I won't change a comma, and most of the time won't even offer solutionsâ€”this way the final decision will always be yours on how to handle certain issues, and you won't have to check if my solution is the correct one.

**You also retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.**

So don't worry, I'm here to make your pattern look good, and to make this process go as painlessly as possible.

## My services

{{< highlight >}}

**I currently offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.**

{{< /highlight >}}
  
**Techniques I'm especially interested in:** stranded colourwork, cable knitting, brioche.

My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos.

This means that I will check: spelling, grammar, use of style, written instructions (including clarity and accuracy), consistency, abbreviations, stitch counts, stitch patterns and repeats, measurements, conversions, schematics, charts with key.

**I'm planning these services in the future:**

- Tech editing for sweaters
- Grading
- Creating schematics
- Creating style sheets
- Layout design

### Fees

{{< highlight >}}

**My hourly editing fee is â‚¬35** (+ VAT if applicable). It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check.

When you contact me, I will give you an estimated time-range, so you'll know what to expect. And I will contact you immediately if the editing requires more time.

When you're ready to jump right in, please read the details below carefully. And if you're still unsure about some things, I would be happy to answer your questions, so just [drop me a line.](/contact)

## The process

The following outlines the ideal process, but I don't disclose every detail here that could be considered business information.
  
**Step 1.** â€” You [contact me](/contact) for availability. Please include the following files and info, if you have them:

- Your pattern, even if it's not yet the version you want edited. A PDF file is preferred, but a Word file or a Pages file is good as well. Regardless of the format, I will send you back an annotated and flattened PDF. (Read more about this in the FAQ below.)

- Some photos of the finished item, so I can check if the pattern would produce the item or not. These images don't have to be fancy, I just need to see details like the ribbing, the stitch pattern, the general shape etc.

- Your style sheet if you have one.

- The date by which you would send me the version to be edited.

- Your deadline if you already have one.

- Whether your pattern has already been test knitted or notâ€”see my note regarding test knitting in the FAQ.

- Whether there are parts of your pattern I should pay extra attention to, or if there are any parts I shouldn't bother with (e.g. if the pattern has a chart, and you exported the written instructions from Stitchmastery, they likely won't need to be checked).

**Step 2.** â€” I respond to your e-mail with my turnaround time (usually 5-7 days), the estimated hours the project will require, my exact terms in the form of an agreement, and my estimated fee. I usually answer within 24-48 hours, except on weekends and holidays. I will let you know whether I can or cannot take on your pattern. I regularly check my spam folder, so it's highly unlikely I will miss your e-mail, but feel free to send a follow-up if I'm suspiciously silent. (For a list of public holidays in Hungary, [check this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Hungary) on Wikipedia. If I am out of office for some other reason, I will set up an auto-reply.)

**Step 3.** â€” We sign the agreement through DocuSign. This way we'll both know what to expect, and can hopefully avoid any misunderstandings. (If you need help with DocuSign, check out [this article](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-do-I-sign-a-DocuSign-document-Basic-Signing?language=en_US) on how to use their free service.)

**Step 4.** â€” After we both sign the agreement, I start editing the pattern. I will contact you immediately if I have any questions or concerns, or if the work requires more time than I thought.

**Step 5.** â€” I send you back my edits. You review them, make the necessary changes, then send me the corrected version, so I can check if everything's in order. If it is, I sign off on the pattern. If it's not, we repeat the process as many times as needed. (Important to note: my initial editing fee covers 3 rounds and a final check.)

**Step 6.** â€”  When your pattern is in a good shape and can be sent to test knitters or be published, I will send you my invoice which you can pay through Wise within 15 days. I will invoice my fee in Euros. You may [use this currency converter](https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/) to check how much that will cost you in your own currency.

**Step 7.** â€” After your pattern has been test knitted, and you've received your feedback from your test knitters, I will be happy to take a look at the pattern again for any additional corrections, just in case we missed something. This step is free if there are no changes to be made, or they don't require much time, or if you still have revision rounds left.

**Step 8.** â€” Publication day. Yay, you've got a finished pattern! Let's shout it from the rooftops! Do let me know when you publish it, so I can share the news with everyone. I will also add the pattern's photo and a link your website or Ravelry store to my portfolio (with your permission, of course).

## FAQ

If you have any questions, please start here. ðŸ˜Š

{{< accordion title="Should test knitting or tech editing come first?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I firmly believe that test knitting should follow tech editing, since you don't want to give a pattern with errors to your test knitters. Think of it like this: correcting mistakes in an author's novel is not the reader's, but the editor's and proofreader's job. ðŸ™‚

Test knitters will spend a lot of time creating an item using your design, so the process should be as smooth for them as possible. Let's be honest: test knitting is free marketing most of the time, and you want your test knitters to write good things about your pattern. They are not tech editors; it is not their job to edit your patterns, especially for free. So I highly, *highly* recommend that you start the test knitting process *after* your tech editor is finished with your pattern.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="PDF, DOC or something else?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

When you send me your pattern, please send it as a PDF, just to make sure we don't run into any formatting issues between operating systems and word processing software.

I always have the latest version of Microsoft Word and Pages, so their native format is always an option, but I'll most likely save your file as a PDF before I start working on it, so I don't change anything by mistake.

I will send you back a flattened PDF, this way we won't run into any compatibility issues. (A flattened PDF just means that you won't be able to move or accidentally delete my comments. The quality will be unchanged, you'll still be able to zoom in, select the text, etc.)

As part of the editing process, I won't change or rewrite the text of your pattern. I will give you my notes, and you can decide what to incorporate and what not to.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Confidentiality" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I will keep our every e-mail and file confidential, and I will never send or say anyone anything about our work, unless you instruct me to. In return, I ask you to do the same.

This obviously doesn't apply to the fact that I edited your pattern: I will proudly share the news of its publication on social media, and will include its photo in my portfolio (with your permission, of course), as well as a link to your website or Ravelry store.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Credit" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

While it's not necessary to do so, I would be over the moon if you would credit me in the colophon of your pattern. I think it's generally a nice thing to do, and it also gives credibility to your work, showing people that "Yes, this pattern was professionally tech edited. This designer cares."
