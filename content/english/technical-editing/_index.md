## What is technical editing?

Anyone who publishes any kind of text needs an editor, a fresh set of eyes to catch mistakes. And since knitting is a specialized area, that editor needs to be a person who knows the ins and outs of knitting.

{{< highlight >}}

**Technical editing for knitting patterns is the process of checking a pattern to make sure the numbers are correct, the style is consistent throughout, all the necessary instructions are there, and it is ready for publication.**

{{< /highlight >}}

A technical editor does not knit the pattern, but checks it theoretically, with a calculator and/or a spreadsheet. The process, depending on the pattern's complexity, takes only a few hours vs. the many weeks or even months a test knitter works on a pattern.

**Tech editing has great value for pattern designers, since a well edited pattern results in a good experience for the makers.**

## My qualification

**Since 2012, I've worked on over 60 novels and short stories as a literary translator, and edited more than 20 novels.** I've also written articles on various topics. I have extensive experience working with various genres and collaborating with translators and editors from diverse backgrounds.

Feel free to check out the list of my publications [here.](/publications)

**In 2024, I completed the technical editing course offered by [The Tech Editor Hub.](https://www.thetecheditorhub.com/)** Joeli is a wonderful teacher who has taught me a great deal about the mechanics of tech editing for knitting patterns and the philosophy of working with pattern designers. And, since it offers a slightly different perspective, I enrolled in [the certification course offered by TKGA.](https://tkga.org/certification-for-technical-editors/)

I'm also an avid knitter who loves learning new techniques and exploring new designs. Rest assured, if something is unfamiliar to me, I will don my librarian hat and start researching.
  
## My philosophy

I know how nerve-wracking it can be to give something you've worked on really hard to someone else. I feel the same way each time a new editor works on my translations.

This is why I strive to create a safe and friendly environment where you won't be judged if you make a mistakeâ€”instead, mistakes are just problems to be solved. No one has to know about them.

And even though I might highlight errors, and give suggestions on how to correct them, I will always, *always* leave the final decision to you. We'll collaborate, but the pattern will always remain yours. In slightly more legal terms: **You will retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.**

I'm here to make your pattern look its best, and to make this process go as painlessly as possible.

## My services

{{< highlight >}}

**I currently offer tech editing for accessories, mainly for socks, mittens, hats, shawls, scarfs and other small items.**

{{< /highlight >}}
  
**Techniques I'm especially interested in:** stranded colourwork, cable knitting, brioche.

My services include checking your pattern for inconsistencies and errors both in the math and in the style. I'll also flag any grammatical errors or typos.

This means that I will check: spelling, grammar, use of style, written instructions (including clarity and accuracy), consistency, abbreviations, stitch counts, stitch patterns and repeats, measurements, conversions, schematics, charts with key.

**I'm planning these services in the future:**

- Tech editing for sweaters
- Grading
- Creating schematics
- Creating style sheets
- Layout design

### Fees

{{< highlight >}}

**My hourly editing fee is â‚¬35** (+ VAT if applicable). It includes three rounds of editing, and a final check.

When you contact me, I will give you an estimated time-range, so you'll know what to expect.

Small, simple items might need 2-3 hours, while larger, more complicated designs could require 4-5 hours to edit.

## The process

The following outlines the ideal process, but I don't disclose every detail here that could be considered business information.
  
**Step 1.** â€” You [contact me](/contact) for availability. Please include the following files and info, if you have them:

- Your pattern, even if it's not yet the version you want edited. You can send me a PDF, but a Word file or a Pages file is good as well. (See FAQ for more on this.)

- Some photos of the finished item, so I can check if the pattern would produce the item or not. These images don't have to be fancy, I just need to see details like the ribbing, the stitch pattern, the general shape etc.

- Your style sheet if you have one.

- The date by which you would send me the version to be edited.

- Your deadline if you already have one.

- Whether your pattern has already been test knitted or not. (See FAQ for more on this.)

- Whether there are parts of your pattern I should pay extra attention to, or if there are any parts I shouldn't bother with (e.g. if the pattern has a chart, and you exported the written instructions from Stitchmastery, they likely won't need to be checked).

**Step 2.** â€” In my response, I will let you know if I can take on the pattern or not, about my turnaround time (usually 5-7 days), the estimated hours the project will require, and my estimated fee. I usually answer within 24-48 hours, except on weekends and holidays, and have an auto-reply set up if I'm away for more time than that. I will also send you my agreement, so you can check my terms.

**Step 3.** â€” We sign the agreement through DocuSign. (If you need assistance with it, I will gladly help, or check out [this article](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-do-I-sign-a-DocuSign-document-Basic-Signing?language=en_US) on how to use their free service. You don't need to scan your signature to use this service.)

**Step 4.** â€” After we're set, I start editing the pattern. When the first round is done, I will send it back to you to make the necessary changes. Then you send it back to me, to check it again for anything we missed. I will contact you immediately if I have any questions or concerns, or if the work requires more time than I thought, to talk about the best course of action.

**Step 5.** â€”  When your pattern is spotless and can be sent to test knitters or be published, I will send you my invoice which you can pay through Wise within 15 days. My fee will be in Euros or Hungarian Forint if you're based in Hungary. You may [use this currency converter](https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/) to check how much that will cost you in your own currency.

**Step 6.** â€” After your pattern has been test knitted, and you've received your feedback from your test knitters, I will be happy to take a look at the pattern again for any additional corrections, just in case we missed something. This step is free if there are no changes to be made or they don't require much time.

Yay, you've got a finished pattern! Let's shout it from the rooftops! Do let me know when you publish it, so I can share the news with everyone. I will include its photo in my portfolio (with your permission, of course), with your name, as well as a link to your website or Ravelry store.

## FAQ

If you have any questions, please start here. ðŸ˜Š

{{< accordion title="Should test knitting or tech editing come first?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I firmly believe that test knitting should follow tech editing, since you don't want to give a pattern with errors to your test knitters. Think of it like this: correcting mistakes in an author's novel is not the reader's, but the editor's and proofreader's job. ðŸ™‚

Test knitters will spend a lot of time creating an item using your design, so the process should be as smooth for them as possible. Let's be honest: test knitting is free marketing most of the time, and you want your test knitters to write good things about your pattern. They are not tech editors; it is not their job to edit your patterns, especially for free. So I highly, *highly* recommend that you start the test knitting process *after* your tech editor is finished with your pattern.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="PDF, DOC or something else?" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

To avoid any formatting issues between operating systems and word processing software, ideally, I would prefer if you would send your pattern as a PDF.

I always have the latest version of Microsoft Word and Pages, so their native format is always an option, but I'll most likely save your file as a PDF before I start working on it, so I don't change anything by mistake. I will send you back a flattened PDF, this way we won't run into any compatibility issues. (A flattened PDF just means that you won't be able to move or accidentally delete my comments. The quality will be unchanged, you'll still be able to zoom in, select the text, etc.)

**Do let me know if you'd prefer a different approach,** like using Adobe Reader's markup functionality, or "Track Changes" and commenting in Microsoft Word. I'm used to both.

During the editing process, I won't change or rewrite the text of your pattern without your knowledge. I will give you my notes and suggestions, and you can decide what to incorporate and what not to.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Confidentiality" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

I will keep our every e-mail and file confidential, and I will never send or say anyone anything about our work, unless you instruct me to. In return, I ask you to do the same.

This obviously doesn't apply to the fact that I edited your pattern: I will proudly share the news of its publication on social media, and will include its photo in my portfolio (with your permission, of course), as well as a link to your website or Ravelry store.

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Credit" class="border-indigo-900 border-1 bg-slate-50" >}}

While it's not necessary to do so, I would be over the moon if you would credit me in the colophon of your pattern. I think it's generally a nice thing to do, and including my name also gives credibility to your work, showing people that this pattern was professionally tech edited. If you credit me, you will still retain all the intellectual property rights of the pattern.
