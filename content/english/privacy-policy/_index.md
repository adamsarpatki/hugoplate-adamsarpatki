I will post a proper privacy policy here soon. For now, just know that I don't track anything on this site, and I don't collect personal details, unless you write me an e-mail or book an appointment. In that case, the details you provide will end up in my PrivateEmail inbox. [Contact me](/contact) if you want me to delete them.
