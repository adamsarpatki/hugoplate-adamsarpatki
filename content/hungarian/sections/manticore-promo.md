      As a kid, I always adored it when a book had a map in it. The first one I encountered was, of course, Tolkien’s map in The Lord of the Rings — the first Hungarian edition has a beautiful version of it, and that definitely kickstarted my fascination with the topic. Then, when my interest in D&D was sparked in 2017, I started a few other related hobbies as well, like painting miniatures, or drawing maps.

      I wanted to take mapmaking more seriously for a while now, and in 2023 I’ve finally taken the first steps to do just that. 
      
      *The Flightless Manticore* blog is one of those first steps.
